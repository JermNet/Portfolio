							This was our final project for our C course, a book management system. It was a challenge to do at first, but in the end it was simply putting concepts we already had together. There were some OOP aspects as we had to have a header file, as well as the book being a separate class from the main. We also had to dynamically allocate an array to accommodate a fluctuating amount of books, and save and load said books to and from dat files. It was an enjoyable challenge, and learning how to dynamically allocate arrays and to save to external files were important skills that I have since applied in other projects.

							This was our final project for Object Oriented Programming. We were tasked with making something graphical, actually had a few options to pick from, with the "default" option being a quiz game. I decided to challenge myself by picking the calculator option. And it certainly was challenging! It was quite difficult getting everything working properly, and there were a lot of moving piece compared to doing something text-based, but it was worth it. I felt as though I was able to get a deeper understanding of Java through this project, and it's been a huge help in understanding Android development since there are a lot of carry overs. It was also nice getting some more practice with JavaDoc and documentation in general.

							This is a more recent project that we've done, meant to teach us the potential C++ has for object oriented code. It was pretty interesting and fun to see the differences between a C++ class compared to a Java class, and applying the concepts here went pretty smoothly. This one also forced me to learn how to dynamically allocate an array in C++, which is surprising different compared to C. Still though, this was a fun assignment to do, and I learned a good amount from doing it.

							This was a truly fun assignment. Our first assignment for this class was a light introduction to Beans as a concept, basically being POJOs plus Beans. This one, however, put us straight into the world of web application programming. It was Java, HTML, databases and Beans all rolled into one. It was certainly difficult since it was learning what new concepts come with making a web application vs. making a website, while also applying what I already knew in new ways. It reminded me that this is what I enjoy most, though. Even through still tying to understand what I didn't yet understand, it wasn't unenjoyable at any point along the journey.

							This assignment was actually kind of like 8 mini assignments in 1! We were tasked with doing 8 JavaScript related tasks, with the image being of one of them. This uses a weather API to get the data and print it onto a webpage. It was a really fun one to do, even if I misunderstood the 8th question and made a web app far before we were supposed to. I made it with XAMPP and an online SQL client, so it won't work as is, but I still think it's important to show off. Learning how to get data from APIs was really fun as well, as well as learning what JavaScript can really do for a webpage. If it weren't for this assignment, you wouldn't be able to open and close this section!

							This was my final project for Website Development, and the website on this scale we had to do. Due to having other projects during this time period, to give the required amount of time for each project, this one had to be done in about 3 days, and all 13 pages there are for it were required! Not only did this one teach me how to do more complex things with CSS, such as slideshows and layered navigation bars bars, but it also really taught me the valuable skill of time management. It was still fun to do, but I wasn't really thinking that as I was trying to get it done, I was just trying to make it nice with the time I had. I think that worked out, and although I think I've made better websites since (like this one!), this is a great one to show my learning.

							Ever since semester 2 of my first year of IT Programming, I have used Git and GitHub like crazy. I honestly can't remember how I lived without it, but I somehow did. All of my projects are on there now, though some of them are private. I also know that many people use the visual versions of Git, be it Git GUI or a built in Git GUI with InteliJ or VSCode, and although I like those versions, I'm much more comfortable with command line Git. Using the commands directly and so often makes it easier to remember what to do. And using Git in the command line if more versatile, especially when switching between IDEs which have different visual versions. Git has saved me from doing projects over from scratch, and I'm certain it will do so in the future.

							Aside from Website Development, Mobile Development has to my favourite realm of programming. This specific assignment was also a real treat because of how many different things there were to it. Of course there was Java, but this one uses Kotlin for the layout and some of the logic as well. I also had to save and load from a database, that's where all the Pokemon are coming from. And to top it all off, I decided I wanted to get the data from a CSV file. So the data is loaded from the file, then into the database, and pulling the data from the database is how it actually gets put onto the layout. That favourite Pokemon is also the one that has been accessed the most amount of times, so that was an interesting yet fun challenge as well.

							This is the schema for our final project for our Database Management class. The main goal of this one was to create a bunch of different commands, all of them you can see within the GitHub repo, as well as a detailed document of how I made this. It was a pretty fun one to do, even with having a time crunch. Though I think that applying the actual database aspects in other projects (like Mobile Development, for example) is a lot more fun and challenging than working with those aspects on their own. This was a great stepping stone though, and it would be much harder to apply those database aspects of other projects without learning them on their own.
