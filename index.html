							Hello! I'm Jeremy! I'm currently enrolled in NSCC's IT Programming course, and am soon to be a graduate. I love all sorts of programming from Java to C to C++ and so on, but my favourite is web development since I get to work with so much. Web development has the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but you also get to work with databases, Java, different libraries and all sorts of things! It's truly amazing, especially when you get to see something you made up and running.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other than programming, I tend to find myself reading, writing and playing video games, all of which still have helped my skill set in some way. Reading often has made me able to read through things quickly whilst still understanding them, which I've found is helpful for sussing out issues. Writing has helped me write good and explanatory comments for more complex blocks of code. And playing video games is mostly for leisure, but is what got me into the whole idea of wanting to be a programmer in the first place.

					<h2>What I Hope To Achieve In The Workplace</h2>

						<p>
							The most important things when taking on a new job is learning what you'll do, fostering relationships and growing as a person and in your career. I hope to achieve all of those things. Actively working together with people is just something that can't be completely replicated through schooling, and is something I'd love to do with my potential coworkers. In school, the people all come from different backgrounds and have experiences, but they all learn the same thing for a reason. In a workplace, that's different. There will likely be people way above, and way below my level of knowledge. Both teaching and being taught are great ways to learn and to grow closer to people, so I'm looking forward to both.
